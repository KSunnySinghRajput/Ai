    "“Hey Google. What’s the weather like today?”\n",
    "\n",
    "- This will sound familiar to anyone who has owned a smartphone in the last decade. I can’t remember the last time I took the time to type out the entire query on Google Search. I simply ask the question – and Google lays out the entire weather pattern for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It saves me a ton of time and I can quickly glance at my screen and get back to work. A win-win for everyone! But how does Google understand what I’m saying? And how does Google’s system convert my query into text on my phone’s screen?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is where the beauty of speech-to-text models comes in. Google uses a mix of deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to parse through our query, retrieve the answer and present it in the form of both audio and text.\n",

    "speech_to_text\n",
    "\n",
    "The same speech-to-text concept is used in all the other popular speech recognition technologies out there, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and so on. The semantics might vary from company to company, but the overall idea remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have personally researched quite a bit on this topic as I wanted to understand how I could build my own speech-to-text model using my Python and deep learning skills. It’s a fascinating concept and one I wanted to share with all of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this article, I will walk you through the basics of speech recognition systems (AKA an introduction to signal processing). We will then use this as the core when we implement our own speech-to-text model from scratch in Python.\n",
