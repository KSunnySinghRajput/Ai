    "(ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence</p>\n",

    "**Need for Machine Learning**<br>\n",
    "Human beings, at this moment, are the most intelligent and advanced species on earth because they can think, evaluate and solve complex problems. On the other side, AI is still in its initial stage and haven’t surpassed human intelligence in many aspects. Then the question is that what is the need to make machine learn? The most suitable reason for doing this is, “to make decisions, based on data, with efficiency and scale”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, organizations are investing heavily in newer technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning to get the key information from data to perform several real-world tasks and solve problems. We can call it data-driven decisions taken by machines, particularly to automate the process. These data-driven decisions can be used, instead of using programing logic, in the problems that cannot be programmed inherently. The fact is that we can’t do without human intelligence, but other aspect is that we all need to solve real-world problems with efficiency at a huge scale. That is why the need for machine learning arises.\n",

    "While Machine Learning is rapidly evolving, making significant strides with cybersecurity and autonomous cars, this segment of AI as whole still has a long way to go. The reason behind is that ML has not been able to overcome number of challenges. The challenges that ML is facing currently are −\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Quality of data** − Having good-quality data for ML algorithms is one of the biggest challenges. Use of low-quality data leads to the problems related to data preprocessing and feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Time-Consuming task** - Another challenge faced by ML models is the consumption of time especially for data acquisition, feature extraction and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Lack of specialist persons** − As ML technology is still in its infancy stage, availability of expert resources is a tough job.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **No clear objective for formulating business problems** − Having no clear objective and well-defined goal for business problems is another key challenge for ML because this technology is not that mature yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Issue of overfitting & underfitting** − If the model is overfitting or underfitting, it cannot be represented well for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Curse of dimensionality** − Another challenge ML model faces is too many features of data points. This can be a real hindrance.\n",

    "“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us discuss them more in detail now −\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task(T)**<br>\n",
    "From the perspective of problem, we may define the task T as the real-world problem to be solved. The problem can be anything like finding best house price in a specific location or to find best marketing strategy etc. On the other hand, if we talk about machine learning, the definition of task is different because it is difficult to solve ML based tasks by conventional programming approach.\n",
    "A task T is said to be a ML based task when it is based on the process and the system must follow for operating on data points. The examples of ML based tasks are Classification, Regression, Structured annotation, Clustering, Transcription etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experience (E)**<br>\n",
    "As name suggests, it is the knowledge gained from data points provided to the algorithm or model. Once provided with the dataset, the model will run iteratively and will learn some inherent pattern. The learning thus acquired is called experience(E). Making an analogy with human learning, we can think of this situation as in which a human being is learning or gaining some experience from various attributes like situation, relationships etc. Supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning are some ways to learn or gain experience. The experience gained by out ML model or algorithm will be used to solve the task T.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance (P)**<br>\n",
    "An ML algorithm is supposed to perform task and gain experience with the passage of time. The measure which tells whether ML algorithm is performing as per expectation or not is its performance (P). P is basically a quantitative metric that tells how a model is performing the task, T, using its experience, E. There are many metrics that help to understand the ML performance, such as accuracy score, F1 score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, sensitivity etc.\n",
